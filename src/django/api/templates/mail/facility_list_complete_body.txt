Hi there,

Thanks for submitting {{ list_name }} to the Open Supply Hub. The list has now been processed by our system and the results are available here: {{list_url}}.

What next?

Reviewing your upload:

1. Check for and Resolve Errors: Some entries in your list may have generated an error message. You can review these entries to see whether it’s caused by an error in data entry, such as a country name being mis-spelled, or whether our geo-coder is unable to plot the facility due to the address lacking sufficient details. You can read the Processing data in the OS Hub section of our FAQs (https://info.openapparel.org/faqs#processing-data-in-the-oar) for more information on error types and how to resolve them. Once you have pin-pointed the cause of the error, update your facility information in your Excel/CSV file and re-upload your FULL list to the OS Hub again (uploading one facility at a time results in multiple lists that are harder to manage).

2. Confirm or Reject Potential Matches: In some cases, our algorithm wasn’t certain whether to identify a facility as a match, or whether to create a new entity in the tool. Once you have resolved any errors in your list, next we ask you to filter your list by “Potential matches” and confirm or reject the options presented to you. For more information on this process, see the “What am I meant to do on the confirm / reject page?” question of our FAQ page (https://info.openapparel.org/faqs#uploading-to-the-oar).

3. Data Points Beyond Name and Address: If you uploaded additional data points beyond facility name and address, you will now be able to see them by searching or downloading your contribution from the Open Supply Hub.

Once your list is uploaded and cleaned:

1. See who else is connected with your facilities/suppliers: Once you have contributed to the OS Hub, check out your facility profiles to see which other companies and organizations are connected with the facilities you uploaded. What collaborations could you explore working on together?

2. Share your OS Hub contribution: Link directly to your facility/supplier data on the OS Hub from your website, so your users can easily search and navigate through your list. These free graphics are available (https://info.openapparel.org/stories-resources/assets-for-oar-stakeholders) for use to point users to your OS Hub contribution on your website, LinkedIn profile, and/or on social media. You can also display your facility/supplier data as an interactive map, embedded on your website (https://info.openapparel.org/embedded-map).

3. Encourage your facilities/suppliers to claim their profiles or claim your facility, if you are the owner: By claiming their facilities on the OS Hub, facility owners or senior management can provide facility location data straight from the source, as well as add additional details to their profiles, including MOQs, lead times, certifications, and more.

If you are a brand or organization uploading a facility list, you can find suggested text for a message to your suppliers here (https://info.openapparel.org/stories-resources/encourage-your-facilities-to-claim-their-profiles), to encourage them to claim their profiles.

For any questions, feel free to reach out to the OS Hub team: info@openapparel.org.

All the best,
